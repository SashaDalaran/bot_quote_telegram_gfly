# commands/__init__.py — Commands Package
# ==================================================
#
# Package marker for Telegram command handlers.
#
# Layer: Commands
#
# Responsibilities:
# - Validate/parse user input (minimal)
# - Delegate work to services/core
# - Send user-facing responses via Telegram API
#
# Boundaries:
# - Commands do not implement business logic; they orchestrate user interaction.
# - Keep commands thin and deterministic; move reusable logic to services/core.
